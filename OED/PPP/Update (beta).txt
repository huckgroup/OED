Note this this is a beta version:

The pipeline will be extended in the futures if time permits mainly to reduce the number of background functions:

Are the core files, these interact with potential algorithms: they allow compiled models and measurements to communicate
Model.py
Measurement.py

Model.py returns a model object that is added to a MeasurementObject, all information is there for solver
solvesystem.py

The algorithms that use the measurements are found in:

OptimizeExperiment.py
ParameterOptimizationModelSets.py
